##Simple blog written by me
###Work in progress

This is a simple blogging platform i write in a free time, based on a Flask microframework and SQLAlchemy. It also includes automatic image handling thanks to pillow library, so thumbnails are created automatically when picture is uploaded.

**Installation:**

1. Create virtualenv environment
>> virtualenv <folder_name>

2. Clone this repositiory (inside venv):
>> git clone https://github.com/exaroth/sub_rosa

3. Install using pip:
>> pip install -r requirements.txt

Note this is still a very early version, made purely to teach myself building Flask apps so don't expect anything marvelous

Cheers
