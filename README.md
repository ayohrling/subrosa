## Installation

### Including Images

If you want additional graphics on your blog simply drop them into `uploads` folder, these can be in any common format you like: jpg, png and gif. The files should be named:

* bg -- Image that will be shown on top of index page.
* logo -- Image to be shown instead of plain site title specified in `subrosa.conf`
* portrait -- Your portrait, this image will show up next to your posts as well as on index page, looks best if it's in square format.

Additionally if you want to have favicon on your page, drop file named `favicon.ico` into `uploads`.

Note: None of these images are mandatory.

### Disqus comments

Once you deployed your site into the server, visit [disqus.com](disqus.com) and create account (if you don't have one yet), next go to [http://disqus.com/admin/create/](http://disqus.com/admin/create/) and create new site, lastly enter `disqus_site_shortname` in your Subrosa admin panel to enable the comments.

### Imgur integration

Subrosa also implements simple way to integrate your gallery with Imgur. The advantages of using it are very fast file transfer thanks to their CDN and automatic thumbnail creation, there are limits to how many pictures can be uploaded and downloaded per day though. To enable it create Imgur account, visit [https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps](https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps) and create new app. Lastly input `client_id` provided in your dashboard to get direct imgur uploads on your site.

### Basic configuration

The configuration file is named subrosa.conf and you can find it inside main folder of the repository, The only things to configure are:

* SITE_TITLE -- Self explanatory
* SECRET_KEY -- This can be anything you like as long as you change it, its used for encrypting passwords and other security related stuff.
* DATABASE -- select database type you want to use with Subrosa, available types are sqlite, postgresql and mysql.
* DATABASE_NAME -- name of the database to be used.NOTE: you have to create it yourself.
* USERNAME/PASSWORD -- Credentials used when connecting to database, used only with mysql and postgresql.


NOTE: Database configuration is automatically generated when using Subrosa with Heroku.

NOTE: If you want more configuration options you can find detailed config file inside `main` folder(`default_config.py`).

### Fonts

By default Subrosa uses only fonts available on the system, because of that fonts might render differently depending on the system. If you would like to use custom fonts see *Building own version* below.

## Deployment


At this moment the best solution for deployment is to use Heroku cloud, with this setting Subrosa doesn't require any database configuration, and hey, it's free.

#### Heroku Installation

Instructions below assume you have Heroku toolbelt installed on your system (if not create account on Heroku, visit [https://toolbelt.heroku.com/](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and install it).

* **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/exaroth/subrosa-release.git && cd subrosa-release
```
* **Create heroku app:**
```
heroku create --stack cedar <name_of_your_app>
```
* **Add postgresql database and promote it:**


```
heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql
```


get info about installed db


```shell
heroku pg:info
```


Which should return something like:


```shell
HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_WHITE_URL <== Database name
Plan:        Dev
Status:      available
```
Finally:

```shell
heroku pg:promote HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_WHITE_URL
```

* **Make changes to `subrosa.conf`, add images to 'uploads' folder and commit the changes:**

```shell
git add .
git commit -a -m "Files added"
```

* **Push the contents of the repo to heroku:**


```shell
git push heroku master
```

* **Create tables:**


```shell
heroku run python create_db
```

At this point you should have fully working blog set up on Heroku, once you log in for the first time an account creation screen should pop up. To enter admin panel simply go to `www.your_address.com/admin`. 

To make sure everything went ok type:
```shell
heroku run python check_db
```

### System-wide installation

* **Download release version of Subrosa:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/exaroth/subrosa-release.git && cd subrosa-release
```

* **Install all the requirements:**

```shell
./install 
```
NOTE: Peewee (Database ORM that Subrosa comes with) is not bundled with PostgreSQL and MySQL libraries. To accomodate that, add `--postgres` or `--mysql` when executing `./install`

NOTE: If you receive error when installing psycopg2 or MySQL-python make sure you have `libpg-dev` (for postgres) and `libmysqlclient-dev` (for mysql) installed on your system.

IMPORTANT: As of writing this python 3 doesn't have suitable MySQL python connectors except for the official ones provided by Oracle themselves at [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-versions.html](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-versions.html) - install those instead of default ones if you want to use MySQL database.



* **Configure Subrosa:**

See Configuration above for details

* **Create database and tables:**

First create database, it's name should be the same as the one specified in subrosa.conf file,
then simply execute:

```shell
./create_db
```

* **Run the server:**

Subrosa uses gunicorn WSGI server, to start it run :
```shell
./run.sh
```
from root Subrosa directory.

Basic Gunicorn configuration options are stored in `gunicorn.conf`.

NOTE: Recommended  and most commonly used HTTP Proxy for Gunicorn is Nginx server, to learn about deployment and configuration see [http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/deploy.html](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/deploy.html)

### Building own version

Before you start make sure you have virtualenv installed on your system, aswell as npm, bower, grunt and grunt-cli for handling static files

* First `git clone https://github.com/exaroth/subrosa.git`

* Enter static folder

* bower install && npm install

To compile less files use grunt, it comes with 3 prebuilt tasks

* `grunt` -- Automatically compiles less files on change and refreshes the browser

* `grunt bootstrap_compile` -- Builds bootstrap custom version based on modules specified in `main/static/src/css/bootstrap_custom.less` file

* `grunt build` -- Builds the project: compiles, concatenates, minifies css and js files and copies them into `build` folder NOTE: You have to change paths to all static files in templates yourself


#### Changing the fonts

By default Subrosa uses only fonts commonly available on different operating systems, if you want to go for something slightly more fancy add link to your font in header section of `main/templates/layout.html` then change value representing the font in `main/static/src/css/main.less`, the variables are :
* @body-font -- a serif font used as articles body
* @sans font -- sans serif font used mainly for titles
